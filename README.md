5.Music and sound
6.Main menu, in game menu, and end-game screens

## References
Went through the different tutorials and used that to build a project.
Have one maze to go through which is procedurally generated. Thought 
a future theme sounded fun.

## Future Development
Would want a health bar, reticle, enemies to move after the player, and 
the enemies to do something when shot.
